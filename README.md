**Estimation of Electric Vehicle Range Using Artificial Neural Networks**

- The project "Estimation of Electric Vehicle Range Using Artificial Neural Networks" revolves around creating a predictive model that accurately estimates the range of electric vehicles (EVs) by leveraging artificial neural networks (ANNs).
- By gathering data on various factors influencing EV range, such as battery capacity, vehicle weight, driving conditions, weather, terrain, and driving patterns, the project aims to develop a sophisticated algorithm capable of learning complex relationships between these inputs and the desired output â€“ the EV range.
- Key components of the project include:
  - **Data Collection:** Gathering relevant data on factors affecting EV range.
  - **Data Preprocessing:** Ensuring data consistency and relevance through meticulous preprocessing.
  - **ANN Design:** Creating an ANN architecture capable of capturing intricate relationships.
  - **Training and Validation:** Rigorous processes to train and validate the model.
  - **Testing:** Ensuring the model's reliability through extensive testing.
  - **Evaluation and Optimization:** Fine-tuning the model's performance.
  - **Deployment:** Potentially integrating the model into EV dashboard systems or mobile applications.

- Overall, this project blends machine learning, data science, and electric vehicle technology to offer a valuable tool for both EV owners and manufacturers, facilitating a deeper understanding of EV range dynamics and aiding in optimizing performance across diverse driving scenarios.
